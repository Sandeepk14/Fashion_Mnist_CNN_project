# Fashion_Mnist_CNN_project
A Fashion MNIST CNN project classifies 28x28 grayscale images of clothing (T-shirts, dresses, shoes, etc.) into 10 categories. It involves data preprocessing, designing a CNN with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, and training with optimizers like Adam. 

`Aim`: The primary aim of the Fashion MNIST (FNIST) project is to develop and train a machine learning or deep learning model, typically using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to classify grayscale images of fashion items into 10 distinct categories accurately. These categories include:
-T-shirt/top
-Trouser
-Pullover
-Dress
-Coat
-Sandal
-Shirt
-Sneaker
-Bag
-Ankle boot
